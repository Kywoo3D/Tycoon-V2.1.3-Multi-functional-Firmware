The latest version of Tycoon/Tycoon Max/Tycoon Slim firmware is V2.1.3. It applies on all V1 and V2 firmware machines and is integrated with auto shut-down function, high-temperature printing function, and supports advanced settings. If you have any feedback or questions on the firmware, please write to ðŸ‘‰service@kywoo3d.com.
The "Robin_nano35.bin" file is the firmware for the printer. The "KWWifi.bin" file is the firmware for enabling the WiFi function of the printer.
To enable the WiFi function of your Kywoo Tycoon series printer, you need to flash the WiFi firmware in your printer first.

Kywoo Tycoon/Max/Slim V2.1.3 Multi-functional Firmware Upgrading and Optimization

1.It applies a new BootLoader and the booting speed was reduced by 1.5 times (10sâ†’4s). 

2.No need to calibrate the screen when re-flashing or upgrading the firmware.

3.The WiFi Function is optimized. In previous firmware versions, connecting WiFi network requires a computer, and the transmission speed was slow. Now with the optimized WiFi function, printers can be connected to Cura, which can transfer files relatively quickly. Users can transfer files to the printer, and control and operate the print in Cura.

4.With the V2.1.3 firmware, users can select WiFi on the printer's WiFi page, enter the password to connect to WiFi. The WiFi network will be automatically saved after connection, and it will automatically connect to the saved WiFi next time the machine is turned on. Would be much easier than using mobile phones and computers to connect to WiFi. 

5.With V2.1.3 firmware, the printer automatically saves the data after setting it, instead of tapping the option to save data. 

6.When the filament runs out, the alarm will sound to remind the user to change the filament ASAP. 

7.Reasonably adjust the thermal runaway protection time to reduce the probability of false alarms interrupting the machine due to thermal runaway under normal circumstances. 

8.It added Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese system languages. 

9.The new firmware integrates the auto shut-down function and will automatically detect whether the machine is equipped with auto shut-down module. If yes, the printer will automatically shut down if no operation happens within 20min after a print finished. 

10.The high-temperature printing function is also added, enabling the max hotend temperature up to 300â„ƒ. Users can turn on this function by tapping "settingâ†’configurationâ†’High temperature printing". 

11.The V2.1.3 firmware can apply on all versions of Kywoo printer mainboards so far. 

12.Equipped with Advanced Settings function. 

In order to take into account the needs of 3D printing beginners and pros, the V2.1.3 firmware enables the option of advanced settings. Pro users can tap "Settingâ†’Configurationâ†’Advanced Settings" to check this option and adjust acceleration, jerk, probe offset, PID, linear advance, and other settings. 


Note: Since the firmware was just released, there are inevitably some deficiencies. We highly appreciated it if Kywoo users could provide feedback and help us better optimize and further improve the user experience.
